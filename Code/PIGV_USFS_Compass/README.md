# pIGV1 Compass

This is the code for the car compass. 

It uses the [Arduino Pico](https://github.com/earlephilhower/arduino-pico) core and interfaces with a [USFSMAX Module](https://www.tindie.com/products/onehorse/usfsmax-module-and-carrier/) using [this excellent libraryification of the original interface code](https://github.com/PhiJu5/USFSMAX). But you don't need to download it, it's included in the files here because I needed to make a few modifications.
